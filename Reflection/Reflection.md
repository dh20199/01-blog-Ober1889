# Reflection

In this assignment you've learned very basic HTML and CSS, the content and presentation layers of the web. Take this opportunity to think about how they might relate to your work as a historian. 

## Question 1 (150 words)
#### In Part 2, we explored the use of semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`. These elements make it easier for machines and non-visual browsers to navigate web pages. Why might this be important? (You might want to Google around a bit before answering!)
#### This is important due to the fact that the technologies employed by non-visual browsers rely on the HTML elements to provide structure and organization to the content being displayed. As HTML is universally employed as the foundation of web content, elements such as header, article, and section provide configuration by which a machine can easily process the information. Without these elements machines and non-visual browsing software would need to sequentially process all information causing a significant disadvantage and slowdown in browsing capability. Using these elements however, Non-visual browsers can easily navigate the syntactic structure of a web page, allowing them to browse material in a much more efficient way; just as visual browsers are able to view the structure of a page based on headings and separations/groupings of text .Alternatively without the structure that HTML elements provide, non-visual browsers would need to listen to all the content of a page sequentially until they reached the sought-after material. 

## Question 2 (150 words)
#### In your CSS work, you learned how to change the presentation of material on the web without changing the content. Using a pen and paper, a drawing program, or (if you're feeling ambitious) real HTML and CSS, mock up 2 very different presentations of the information you displayed in your post. Put images of them on the Internet somewhere (but not in this repository) and link to them here. Write a brief paragraph discussing the effect of the presentaiton layer on the reader.
#### The first presentation layer is a colorful and more landscape-based layout. It would be more appealing to a youthful audience. It doesnâ€™t require as much scrolling, and the information could be read all on one tablet sized screen. The focus is also more on the words which gives more imagination to the reader. I imagine this layout for an elementary school student, looking for a snapshot piece of information. The second, vertically aligned layout would be well placed for a phone screen, say for a university or high school student rushing to learn about a topic on the way to class on the subway. The second set of photos are also larger, which would create a lasting impression on the readers, making it easier to recall the information for those who are visual learners. By altering the presentation of these two layouts, the information is geared to different audiences and reading mediums. It has taught me that the designer has to think more than about what to publish, but what the visual aim is as well.
