                        <P>Archduke Charles Von Teschen is considered to be one of the most influencial military 
                        of the late 18th and early 19th ceentury. Brother to Emperor Francis of Austria, 
                        Archduke Charles was born in Florence in 1771; however, he spent much of his early life
                        in the Austrian Neatherlands. He is most famous for his military reforms, and for having been 
                        the first coalition general to defeat Napoleon Bonaparte in battle.

                            <p> In the wake of the disastrous Battle of Austerlitz on the Pratzen Heights and the
                                colapse of the Third Coalition, it became apparent that there was 
                                an urgent requirement to put aside political agendas and install
                                competent leader at the head of the Imperial Army. In lightt of
                                Archduke Charles's recent successful campaingn in Italy, he was 
                                chosen as Fieldmarshall. He embarked on an agenda of military reforms, 
                                which were put to the test in 1809 when he met Napoleon Bonaparte at 
                                the Battle of Aspern-Essling.
                            </p>

                                The Battle of Aspern-Essling took place from 21 to 22 MAy of 1809, represented
                                a significant moment in history; Napoleon Bonaparte's first defeat. After two days of brutal 
                                fighting in the towns of Aspern and Essling and surounding terrain, Archduke Charle's
                                reformed army proved itself by staunchly defeating Napoleon's Grand Armee. 
                                The battle was hard fought by both sides, filled with moments of peril, and displys of
                                great courage. It was a historic moment, as the world had come to realize
                                that Napoleon Bonaparte could be defeated.
